# Macros And Layouts

Two of the most important "not just declarations" surfaces in `bic` are:

- macro inventory
- macro provenance
- compiler-probed type layouts

Together they close a large part of the gap between syntax-only header extraction and ABI-aware binding generation.

## Macro Inventory

`BindingPackage.macros` captures macro definitions seen during raw-header scans.

Each `MacroBinding` carries:

- `name`
- `body`
- `function_like`
- `form`
- `kind`
- `category`
- optional parsed `value` for bindable integer/string constants

`BindingPackage.macro_provenance` carries aligned package-level provenance entries for captured
macros, including origin classification and source location where line-marker evidence is available.

### Macro Kind

Current kinds are:

- `Integer`
- `String`
- `Expression`
- `Other`

This is a structural classification of the macro body.

### Macro Category

Current categories are:

- `BindableConstant`
- `ConfigurationFlag`
- `AbiAffecting`
- `Unsupported`

This is a higher-level classification intended to help downstream generators and planners decide which macros are relevant.

## Why Macro Capture Matters

Many real C APIs encode essential information in macros:

- integer constants
- version identifiers
- feature toggles
- calling-convention selectors
- export/import annotations
- ABI-affecting packing or configuration knobs

Without macros, a binding package is often incomplete even if declaration extraction succeeded.

## Practical Macro Interpretation

Downstream tools should usually treat categories differently:

- `BindableConstant`: good candidates for generated constants
- `ConfigurationFlag`: environment and availability signals
- `AbiAffecting`: do not ignore; these may change layout or calling behavior
- `Unsupported`: evidence worth reporting, not blindly generating

## Layout Probing

`TypeLayout` currently stores:

- `name`
- `size`
- `align`

The layouts are produced by compiler-assisted probing.
That means they reflect the configured compiler environment rather than guessed sizes.

## Probe Through The API

You can probe layouts during a scan:

```rust
let result = HeaderConfig::new()
    .header("api.h")
    .probe_type_layout("struct api_context")
    .probe_type_layout("struct api_options")
    .process()?;
```

Or directly:

```rust
use bic::{probe_type_layouts, HeaderConfig};

let cfg = HeaderConfig::new()
    .header("api.h")
    .include_dir("include");

let report = probe_type_layouts(&cfg, &["struct api_context".into()])?;
println!("{:?}", report.layouts);
```

`AbiProbeReport` also preserves target/compiler identity metadata alongside the layouts.
That makes probe evidence auditable and safer to hand across process or repo boundaries.

## What Layouts Solve

Compiler-probed layouts are especially useful for:

- checking that opaque vs non-opaque modeling matches reality
- proving `sizeof` and `alignof` for important structs
- gating generation on ABI-sensitive records
- preserving ABI evidence in a transportable JSON package

## What Layouts Do Not Yet Solve

Current layout data is intentionally small.
It does not yet provide a full field-offset or bitfield-layout model.

So treat `TypeLayout` as:

- stronger than guessing
- not yet a complete ABI proof for all record shapes

That distinction is important when building a "full binder/linker" layer on top.
