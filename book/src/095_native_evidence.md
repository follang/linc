# Native Evidence

This section groups the parts of LINC that compare source-side intent against
native artifact-side evidence.

Read this section when you care about:

- what symbols an artifact exports or imports
- what native link inputs a package declares
- whether declarations and artifacts agree strongly enough for downstream use

The normal reading order inside this section is:

1. Symbol Inventories
2. Link Surface
3. Validation

Use this path when you are moving from "I have a source contract" to "I trust
this native surface enough to generate and link against it".

The architectural rule stays the same here too:

- LINC consumes source-shaped input
- LINC emits evidence artifacts
- downstream generation still happens elsewhere
