# Field Stability

This chapter classifies the current `BindingPackage` artifact by stability
expectations.

It does not mean every field is frozen forever.
It means downstream consumers have an explicit guide for what is safer to rely
on in the currently documented and tested shape.

## Top-Level `BindingPackage`

The top-level package fields fall into three practical groups:

- contract identity fields
- stable container fields
- evolving evidence fields

## Contract Identity Fields

These are the primary package identity and artifact-shape fields:

| Field | Current classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | required contract field | artifact-shape gate |
| `linc_version` | stable provenance field | producer version, not the main shape gate |
| `source_path` | useful provenance field | helpful, but not the primary artifact anchor |

## Stable Container Fields

These are the major package sections downstream tools can reasonably depend on existing:

| Field | Current classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `target` | stable container | nested contents may grow |
| `inputs` | stable container | nested contents may grow |
| `macros` | stable container | macro modeling still evolving |
| `layouts` | stable container | probe richness still evolving |
| `link` | stable container | resolution semantics still evolving |
| `items` | stable container | declaration modeling still evolving |
| `diagnostics` | stable container | taxonomy may still deepen |

The important distinction is:

- the container concepts are stable enough to build around
- not every nested field should be assumed permanently frozen yet

## Nested Stability Guidance

## `target`

Current nested fields such as target triple, compiler command, compiler version, and flavor should be treated as:

- stable descriptive metadata
- additive/defaultable

Consumers may rely on the presence of the `target` object.
They should not assume no new target metadata will ever be added.

## `inputs`

The `inputs` object should be treated as:

- stable input provenance container
- additive/defaultable

Entry headers, include dirs, and defines are safe concepts to consume.
The exact set of input metadata may still grow.

## `macros`

Macro inventory is a stable concept.
Its precise semantic richness is still evolving.

Consumers may safely rely on:

- the existence of macro inventory
- macro names and bodies being preserved when captured

Consumers should be cautious about treating the current kind/category set as the final maximum taxonomy.

## `layouts`

Layout evidence is a stable concept.
The current `TypeLayout` shape is still minimal.

Consumers may rely on:

- package-level layout evidence existing
- current size/align data when present

Consumers should not assume this is the full eventual ABI layout model.

## `link`

The normalized link surface is a stable concept and a core downstream contract area.

Consumers may rely on:

- package-level link metadata existing
- libraries/frameworks/artifacts/ordered inputs being preserved as concepts

Consumers should expect:

- additional metadata
- richer resolution semantics
- future resolved-planning data in addition to the current descriptive surface

## `items`

Binding items are the core declaration payload and are stable as a container concept.

Consumers may rely on:

- function, record, enum, typedef, variable, and unsupported item variants existing as current categories

Consumers should still assume nested type/declaration fidelity will deepen over time.

## `diagnostics`

Diagnostics are a stable concept.
Their taxonomy and richness may still expand.

Consumers may rely on:

- diagnostics being part of the returned package
- diagnostics representing analysis findings rather than transport failure

Consumers should avoid assuming the current set of diagnostic kinds is final.

## Practical Rule For Downstream Consumers

Today, the safest posture is:

1. rely on top-level package sections and documented meanings
2. treat nested metadata as additive/defaultable unless explicitly documented as a shape gate
3. use `schema_version` as the hard artifact boundary
4. avoid assuming current minimal models are final models

This is the right balance between "the contract is meaningless" and "every nested field is frozen forever."
