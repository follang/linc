# LINC Reference

LINC is the link and binary evidence layer in the `parc -> linc -> gerc`
toolchain.

It owns evidence, not parsing and not lowering, but the crate surface today is
broader than the preferred top-level story. Both the contract-first APIs and
the older low-level IR/bootstrap APIs are still real.

## What LINC Is For

LINC turns normalized source intent into native evidence. It can:

- normalize declared link requirements
- inspect object, archive, and shared-library artifacts
- probe ABI-relevant layouts
- validate declarations against binary reality
- serialize the resulting evidence for downstream consumers

## What LINC Produces

The main outputs are:

- `LinkAnalysisPackage`
- `SymbolInventory`
- `ResolvedLinkPlan`
- `ValidationReport`
- `AbiProbeReport`

Those outputs are transportable evidence artifacts. The preferred modern
consumer path is `SourcePackage -> LinkAnalysisPackage`, but LINC also still
exposes `BindingPackage` and lower-level IR for direct inspection and staged
work.

## Data Flow

```text
normalized source input
  -> linc analysis
  -> link/binary evidence artifacts
  -> downstream consumer
```

In practice the preferred input is `SourcePackage`, the preferred analysis
entrypoint is `analyze_source_package`, and symbol/probe/validation are layered
evidence on top.

## Ownership Boundary

LINC owns:

- the evidence model
- the link surface
- the validation story
- the ABI probe story

LINC does not own:

- parser internals
- source preprocessing internals
- Rust code generation
- library-level composition with `parc` or `gerc`

Composition across packages belongs in tests, examples, or external harnesses.

## Modules And APIs

The root APIs are:

- `analyze_source_package`
- `inspect_symbols`
- `probe_type_layouts`
- `resolve_link_plan`
- `validate`

The root also still re-exports many low-level IR and report types, and tests
exercise those paths directly.

The important modules are:

- `intake`
- `analysis`
- `link_plan`
- `probe`
- `symbols`
- `validate`
- `diagnostics`
- `error`

`raw_headers` still exists for repo-local bootstrap and fixture work. It is not
the architectural center of the crate, but it is still a public low-level
surface that the book needs to acknowledge honestly.
